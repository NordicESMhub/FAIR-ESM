7 core Workflows
=================

We have identified 7 different types of workflows:
- W1 - Workflow “Running an Earth System Model to simulate specific events/scenarios (for example changing CO2, or more generally forcings or other model inputs, generating volcanic eruptions, experiment with geoengineering) or for systematic sensitivity studies: running the same source code with different parameters”
- W2 - Workflow “Analyzing and comparing existing simulation outputs (CMIP, etc.)”
- W3 - Workflow “Analyzing and comparing model outputs against observations (co-design)”
- W4 - Workflow “ESM outputs used as input for different models or studies (downscaling, transport modelling/tracking, impacts)”
- W5 - Workflow “Developing an Earth System Model with source modifications, new parameterizations, possible automated testing”
- W6 - Workflow “Running an Earth System Model in an intercomparison framework (well defined protocol)”
- W7 - Workflow “Developing diagnostics and performance metrics tools for routine evaluation of Earth System Models in CMIP”
